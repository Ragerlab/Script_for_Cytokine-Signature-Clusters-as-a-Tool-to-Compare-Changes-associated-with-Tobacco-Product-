## Demographics Analysis (Table 1)
- Calculated demographics statistics to determine if there were differences across smoking statuses.


## Descriptive Statistics (Table S1)
- Calculated mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for the overall cohort, non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette smokers by compartment.


## Baseline Analysis (Figure 1 and Figure S1)
- Calculating and visualizing mean and standard deviation of baseline (non-smokers) concentrations for each cytokine (Figure 1). 
- Running Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality between each compartment (NLF, ELF, Sputum, or Serum) at baseline. 
- Calculating and visualizing median and standard deviation of baseline (non-smokers) concentrations for each cytokine (Figure S1).
