## Cytokine Distribution Comparison (Table S2)
- Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare baseline & cigarette smoker distributions or baseline & e-cigarette smokers by compartment


## Cytokine Distribution Comparison (Table S3)
- Used ANOVA test as a crude model (serving as similar function as original Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests) to compare ANCOVA results. ANCOVA was run to control for age.

## Cytokine Demographics Distribution Comparison (Table S4)
- Running Wilcoxon tests like for Table S2, this time further stratifying by demographic variables. 

## Cytokine Distribution Comparison (not in manuscript)
- Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare baseline cytokine concentrations across compartments.
