## Spearman Correlations (Table 2)
- Ran Spearman rank correlation tests to determine correlation between each compartment (NLF, NELF, Sputum, Serum) stratified by smoking status. 


## Simulation Analysis (Figure 2)
- Performed bootstrapping (simulated 500 concentration data points) to see if randomly generated data would yield similar statistically significant and highly correlated results between each across compartments.
