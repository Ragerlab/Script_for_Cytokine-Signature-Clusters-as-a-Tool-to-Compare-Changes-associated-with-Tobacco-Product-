## Cluster Distribution Comparison (Table S5)
- Used ANOVA test as a crude model (serving as similar function as original Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests) to compare ANCOVA results. ANCOVA was run to control for age (Table S3). This is the same analysis in the cytokine distribution comparison, but now we are comparing clusters of cytokines rather than individual cytokines.

## Cytokine Demographics Distribution Comparison (Table S6)
Running Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests and stratifying subjects based on the demographic variable of interest (race, ethnicity, sex, age, or bmi) further stratifying compartment to determine how cytokine distributions varied for each variable.
