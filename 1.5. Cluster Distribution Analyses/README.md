## Cluster Distribution Comparison (Table 4)
- Used Wilcoxon Rank sum test to determine if eigencytokines were significantly different across smoking statuses. 

## Cluster Distribution Comparison_ANOVA_ANCOVA (not in manuscript)
- Used ANOVA test as a crude model (serving as similar function as original Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests) to compare ANCOVA results. ANCOVA was run to control for age (Table S3). This is the same analysis in the cytokine distribution comparison, but now we are comparing clusters of cytokines rather than individual cytokines.
