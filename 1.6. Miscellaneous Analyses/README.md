## Individual Cytokine Rankings (not in manuscript)
- Gave each cigarette or e-cigarette smoker a score based on the amount of deviation from baseline for each cytokine .
- Each smoker was then ranked from 1-42 with the top 5 deviators used for the top deviators visualization.

## Top Deviators Analysis (not in manuscript)
- Calculating and visualizing ('Individual_Smoker_Rankings') mean and standard deviation of smokers (either cigarette or e-cigarette smokers) that were the top 5 deviators amongst the smokers. 
- Baseline mean and standard deviation were also plotted for comparison and the plot was stratified by compartment. 

## Cotinine Analysis (not in manuscript)
- Running Spearman correlation tests to determine association between cytokine and cotinine concentrations across compartments.
